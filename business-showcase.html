            <h2>1. Climate Change Dashboard</h2>
            <p>I designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw greenhouse gas emissions data into clear, actionable insights. This involved sourcing and preparing data, importing it into Power BI, and building a structured data model to support effective visual analysis. I explored multiple visual formats and refined the dashboard to highlight the key story: where CO₂ emissions are occurring, why they are rising, and what impacts they are having globally.</p>
